Every 4 months, we challenge creators to make a game from scratch in a weekend. <cite><a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare website</a></cite></blockquote><p>I've been participating in Ludum Dare competition and jam events since December 2010, when I was only just barely getting started with game development. Every time I compete I try to do something I've never done before, and so LD has strongly shaped my approach to design and development. I've learned a lot from Ludum Dare, even when my games aren't the greatest. That said, I also have quite a few games that I'm proud of, which I'll highlight here.</p><p>For a complete list of my LD games, visit my author pages on the Ludum Dare sites:</p><ul><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/thristhart">Legacy Ludum Dare site</a></li><li><a href="https://ldjam.com/users/thristhart/games">New site</a></li></ul><div class="portfolio-items"><section id="sneaky-link"><div class="details"><h2>SneakyLink</h2><ul class="facts"><li>Ludum Dare 29 competition</li><li><time datetime="2014-04-25">April 25th, 2014</time></li><li>Theme: Beneath the Surface</li><li>#16 in Innovation out of 1491 entries</li></ul><p>SneakyLink is a chat-based game, in which you are attempting to infiltrate a group of script kiddies, one of which is supposed to have stolen some important document. It is built on a javascript windowing engine and psuedo-chat framework that I built in the 48-hour competition, which unfortunately didn't leave enough time to finish the writing. Still, it shows off the possibilities of a game built on this fake-OS interface, which was later proven by games like <a href="http://emilyisaway.com/">Emily is Away</a> in 2015 and <a href="https://www.adultswim.com/games/pc-console/kingsway/">Kingsway</a> in 2017.</p><ul class="links"><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=3164">SneakyLink on Ludum Dare</a></li><li><a href="http://thristhart.github.io/ld48-29/">Play SneakyLink</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/Thristhart/ld48-29">View source on github</a></li></ul></div><div class="imageContainer"><img class="primary" data-src="https://static.tom.shea.at/./assets/sneakylink.png" alt="sneakylink has a retro operating system interface, with a fake chat interface"></div></section><section id="cover"><div class="details"><h2>cover</h2><ul class="facts"><li>Ludum Dare 31 competition</li><li><time datetime="2014-12-05">December 5th, 2014</time></li><li>Theme: Entire Game on One Screen</li></ul><p>cover is an experiment in trying to put a lot of depth into an interface without ever opening any new windows or menus (thus keeping the "entire game on one screen" theme). It's also an incremental game, back from when that genre wasn't as well known as it is now and Cookie Clicker was the go-to example. I wanted to make a more physical sort of incremental game, where the resource you accumulate directly impacts the space you're playing in. The interface ended up a little confusing, but once you understand it it's pretty fluid. This game also features the dumb jokes I like to put in my LD games, like the "armory" that generates stick arms for your snowmen.</p><ul class="links"><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=3164">cover on Ludum Dare</a></li><li><a href="http://tom.shea.at/ld48-31release/">Play cover</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/thristhart/ld48-31">View source on github</a></li></ul></div><div class="imageContainer"><video autoplay muted playsinline loop src="https://static.tom.shea.at/./assets/cover.mp4"><video></video></video></div></section><section id="whistle-command"><div class="details"><h2>WHISTLE COMMAND</h2><ul class="facts"><li>Ludum Dare 32 competition</li><li><time datetime="2015-04-17">April 17th, 2015</time></li><li>Theme: An Unconventional Weapon</li><li><img src="https://static.tom.shea.at/./assets/gold.gif" alt> #1 in Innovation out of 1353 entries</li><li><img src="https://static.tom.shea.at/./assets/gold.gif" alt> #1 in Theme out of 1353 entries</li><li>#13 in Fun out of 1353 entries</li></ul><p>WHISTLE COMMAND was my second idea for this competition, after wasting the first half of the 48 hours on <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/05/11/whistle-command-post-mortem/">an idea that I ended up completely scrapping</a>. Microphone input via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a> was only very recently available, and I had been itching to use it in something, so I tried a simple prototype of controlling the position of a dot with the pitch from your microphone. I found it immediately engaging and built a little game around it with my remaining time. I did not have very much time for the graphics, which is... apparent.</p><p>It was the most positive feedback I've ever recieved in a Ludum Dare, winning first place in both the Innovation and Theme categories. It also led to a comment that I aspire to replicate with everything I build:</p><blockquote>Oh my god this is such a great idea. I literally could not get past the rapid fire because I started laughing too much. I've never seen a mechanic convey laughter that well before. <cite>foolmoron on Ludum Dare</cite></blockquote><ul class="links"><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-32/?action=preview&uid=3164">WHISTLE COMMMAND on Ludum Dare</a></li><li><a href="https://tom.shea.at/ldjam32/">Play WHISTLE COMMAND</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/thristhart/ldjam32/">View source on github</a></li></ul></div><div class="imageContainer"><video autoplay muted playsinline loop src="https://static.tom.shea.at/./assets/whistle.mp4"><video></video></video></div></section><section id="flow"><div class="details"><h2>Flow</h2><ul class="facts"><li>Ludum Dare 34 jam</li><li><time datetime="2015-12-11">December 11th, 2015</time></li><li>Theme: Two Button Controls, Growing</li><li>#16 in Mood out of 1634 entries</li><li>#46 in Theme out of 1634 entries</li></ul><p>Ludum Dare 34 was unusual in that the two highest-voted themes were tied, and so it was a dual-theme jam -- you could use either or both themes in your entry. I knew immediately that I wanted to use both, and that I wanted to make something relaxing and chill. In the LD prior to this one (33), I started to partipate in the Jam rather than the Competition, which meant I had an extra day and could work with a team. This meant a marked increase in the quality of my art assets, as I could lean on friends who are much better at it than me! I also made use of <a href="https://bbatv.bandcamp.com/">bbatv's wonderful song ", isn't the rain nice today?"</a> which adds a lot of atmosphere to the game.</p><ul class="links"><li><a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?action=preview&uid=3164">Flow on Ludum Dare</a></li><li><a href="http://corvus.club/flow/">Play Flow</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/CorvusClub/ludum-dare-34">View source on github</a></li></ul></div><div class="imageContainer"><video autoplay muted playsinline loop src="https://static.tom.shea.at/./assets/flow.mp4"><video></video></video></div></section><section id="thanks"><div class="details"><h2>thanks, I hate it!</h2><ul class="facts"><li>Ludum Dare 40 jam</li><li><time datetime="2017-12-01">December 1st, 2017</time></li><li>Theme: The more you have, the worse it is</li><li>#41 in Theme out of 1847 entries</li></ul><p>With thanks, I hate it!, I wanted to create something that surprised you with what it was willing to do.
